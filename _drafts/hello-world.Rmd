I have been toying with the idea of creating a website for some time now. The two main reasons behind this are to provide a resource that I (or anyone else!) can look back at to recall processes or past work and to showcase some of my projects.

I am using Jekyll as a static site generator with GitHub pages for this site. I have a more polished site ([www.elliothenry.com](http://www.elliothenry.com/)) developed using [Wix](http://www.wix.com/). Eventually, I may merge the two ... maybe after my Wix subscription expires.

I hope you enjoy!

I am a data science professional with experience in operations, digital marketing, and retail. My educational background and work experience have allowed me to develop a diverse range of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization skills. I tend to use R and Python in my projects, but am always looking to expand my toolkit. Aside from data and analytics, I enjoy spending time with my family, snowboarding, and playing overly complicated board games.

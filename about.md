I am an insights and analytics professional with experience in operations and market research. My educational background and work experience have allowed me to develop a diverse range of data analysis and data visualization skills. I traditionally use R and Python for my work, but am always looking to expand my toolkit. Aside from data and analytics, I enjoy spending time with my family, snowboarding, and playing overly complicated board games.
